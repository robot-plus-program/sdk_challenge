There are folowing examples available:
1. Live view
2. h.264 streaming

***
1. Live view

This example shows a video from the camera with a Gstreamer pipeline. 
To run the example, double click on the script or execute it in terminal:

$ ./liveview.sh

***
2. h.264 streaming
This example demonstrates how an h.264 encoded stream can be created, and how to receive and decode it on another computer.
To run the streamimg part of the example double click on the script or execute it in terminal:

$ ./h264streaming.sh

Copy the receiveH264stream.sdp (receiveH265stream.sdp) file to the receiving computer and open the file in a suitable player (e.g. VLC). Make sure the receiving and the sending computer are in the same local network. Please note that this file is also available for download at https://github.com/TheImagingSource/Linux-tiscamera-Programming-Samples/tree/master/Raspberry-Pi-4-devkit-samples

Please note that the Raspberry Pi is only capable of hardware encoding an h.264 stream up to 1920x1080 at 30 fps. Therefore, for sensors having a native resolution above 1920x1080 (e.g. IMX335), a dedicated example bash script is provided called 'h264streaming-hi-res-sensors.sh' . It specifically selects full hd resolution for the sensor.
